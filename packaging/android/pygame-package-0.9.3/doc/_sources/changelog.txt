Changelog
=========

Pygame Subset for Android 0.9.3
-------------------------------

Important: An application must call :func:`android.init` before it can receive
input events. This prevents a crash on input.

PGS4A now uses Python 2.7.1.

The :func:`android.get_dpi` function retrieves the display DPI.

The :func:`android.show_keyboard` and :func:`android.hide_keyboard` functions
show and hide the on-screen keyboard. For now, the application is responsible
for mapping android keys to pygame keys, and then to unicode.

The following modules have been added by default: urllib2, io, uuid,
json. The following encodings have been added: idna, base64, hex.

The sqlite and PIL libraries are available, and can be enabled with the
--with-sqlite3 and --with-PIL options. 


Pygame Subset for Android 0.9.2
-------------------------------

The packaging tool now include PGS4A as part of the packages it
builds. While this makes the packages somewhat larger, doing this
prevents the end user from having to download a second package to run a
game, and allows multiple PGS4A games to run simultaneously. It also
ensures that changes to PGS4A will not break games on user devices.

The packaging tool has been rewritten, and now takes more options. It
allows permissions (allowing vibration and internet access) to be
supplied on a per-application basis. It also allows the presplash
screen to be specified on a per-application basis. 

Windows support has been added to the packaging tool.

The new :func:`android.vibrate` function allows an application to
request that the device vibrate for some period of time.

The new :func:`android.accelerometer_enable` and `android.accelerometer_reading`
functions allow reading the device's accelerometer.
